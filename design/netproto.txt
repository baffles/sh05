Allegro Battle Ground client/server protocol

Commands are 3 chars long, so chop off the first 4 chars, 3 for the command and
1 for its trailing space. The prefix is only specified when the server sends the
client games messages. The prefix format is <name>!<socket>

The socket file descripter (int) shall be used also as a user id, as there will
be a unique sockfd for each user.

are at least x bots playing.
